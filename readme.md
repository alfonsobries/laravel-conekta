Note: This package is still in development so be aware after you use it.

## Introduction

Laravel Conekta Cashier provides an expressive, fluent interface to [Conekta's](https://www.conekta.com/) subscription billing services. It handles almost all of the boilerplate subscription billing code you are dreading writing. 

## Official Documentation

This package is based in the [Laravel Cashier](https://github.com/laravel/cashier) package so most of the documentation in the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs/billing) could apply.
